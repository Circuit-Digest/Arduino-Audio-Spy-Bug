In this project we are going to build an audio bug using Arduino and NRF24L01. This audio spy bug is highly customizable and can be easily integrated with other devices and systems. The NFR24L01 module allows transmission over specific channel, ensuring that our transmissions remain private up to a level. This device is perfect for monitoring a baby room, keeping an eye on a pet, or even for professional surveillance. With its small size and easy portability, this audio spy bug is a must-have for anyone in need of discreet and reliable audio recording. The transmitter circuit is battery powered and has the battery protection built in. The small size of the project makes it very versatile and useful. Regardless of the small size it provides reasonable sound quality as well as transmission range.
